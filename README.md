# RESTFEP Analysis 
Here, in this repo,  I will collect all the scripts required to do analysis after running alchemical transformation and ddG calculation by  combination of Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering and Free Energy Perturbation (**REST2/FEP**) for different cases of mutation as listed : 
## Case 1) one_sub_mutation
In this dir I will show scripts to analysis the typical case, the substitution mutation and only one mutation 

## Case 2) double_sub_mutation
In this dir I will show scripts to analysis double mutation cases 

## Case 3) add_del_mutation
In this dir I will show scripts to analysis addition and deletion mutations 

Here, I will add output files and trajectories, to be able to use them as example for the data and reproduce the output figures.
